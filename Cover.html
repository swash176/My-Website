<H3>Experience Summary</H3>
<p>I have been fortunate enough to have held a few different positions within the aviation over the years, starting a fleet service clerk for American Eagle Airlines. While in that postion I had the chance to work ground operations, loading and unloading bags, and cargo, bagroom operations, de-icing operation and cabin cleaning. Through my hunger for more knowledge and responsibilty I was able to learn and be certified as a aircraft reposition team member both in and out of the cockpit. I also went through corperate training to become a certified environmental coordinator and a certified crew chief. After my time at American, I moved to jetBlue Airways where again I worked in ground operations loading and unloading bags and cargo, and de-icing operations. My skills and knowledge earned me a position on the stations aircraft reposition team where I worked both on in the field doing aircraft repositions as well as in the operations center coordinating the teams operation. Being in the operations center I was able to pickup and learn things about the station operations as a whole.
During this time I pickup a volunteer position with the New York City Police Department as an Auxiliary Police Officer where I worked side by side with full time police officers handling different aspects of police duties. This lasted for 7 years until leaving New York City. After leaving jetBlue Airways I worked for The City of New York Department of Transportation where I was a operations communications specialist working with the Highway Inspection and Quality Assurance unit. In that role I operated as the dispaycher for the units largest borough, doing from managing the units public complaints aka 311 system, dispatching inspectors on emergency calls, coordinating agency/contractor meetings, communicating with agency executives and much more. 
I was in this roll until leaving NYC. My next position I was a dispatch/customer service rep with a concrete companie in the Northern Virgina Area. While in that position I gained enough knowledge to where I was allowed to take on some of my supervisors functions, covering weekend solo, doing daily driver scheduling and learning plant operations functions. Following that job I transitiond to the job I have know where I am the dispatch manager for a freight forwarding company managing the day to day operations of the drivers crew and assuring the movement of freight the company is charged with.</p>
<H3>My Perceived Calling</H3>
<p>I feel my perceived calling is to work within the aviation industry as that is where I had the most fun and aviation is a passion of mine. Throughout all my years one thing I never let go of was aviation, all my studies have been focused on aviation and a lot of my drive is aviation related. I have no doubt that I can excel in anything I do, however Iâ€™ll have the greatest joy when its aviation related.</p>

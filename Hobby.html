<p>One of my greatest passions is aviation, I enjoy all aspects of the aviation world. I can be found plane spotting at random airports, or you can find me somewhere watching flight sim live streams, listening to aviation podcast, or if you look up and see a Cessna flying over that just may be me. I'm a collector of model airplanes, some would say I have more than enough Skymark models. What can I say it's aviation it’s my thing. You ever look and ask yourself, how does this machine soar through the air, like how is this possible?</p>
 
<p>If I'm not out doing something aviation related you may just find me on the shore or out on the water dropping a line, trying to catch some dinner. Fishing is an activity I got into through some martial arts buddies of mine, and I’ve enjoyed it ever since, one minute you can be sitting around waiting for a bite and the next you can be fighting a nice sized striped bass. Always good to catch up with friends and drop a line.</p>
 
<p>Martial Arts has been a part of my life since the age of 10, I’ve studied and gained ranking and teach in 3 different styles of martials arts: VeeJitsu, Goju Ryu and Shindo Ryu Karate. While always a student of the martial arts I do hold the distinction and honor of being an instructor.</p>  

<p>Interestingly enough, I actually am not a fan of golf, I don’t watch any golf events and I couldn’t tell you what the rules to the game are, however I do have a lot of fun going out to TopGolf and trying to hit that ball as hard as possible and get it downrange. I like playing some of the mini games that TopGolf has, one of my favorites being the TopGolf edition Angry Birds. Going to the driving range is a great way to have fun and connect with friends and family.</p>
